              What is the purpose of Windows Server CAL licenses and how do they
              benefit businesses?
            </h4>
            <p>
              In order to utilize services or tools provided by your business
              servers that require Client Access Licenses (CALs), you need to
              deploy licenses for your customers or staff members to access
              them. TheKeymind offers two types of CAL licenses: USER CAL, which
              is associated with a named user and their personal credentials,
              and DEVICE CAL, which is linked to specific devices based on their
              machine address. Assess your requirements with your internal
              experts or consult TheKeymind's customer service for guidance on
              determining the most suitable CAL license type for your specific
              use case.
