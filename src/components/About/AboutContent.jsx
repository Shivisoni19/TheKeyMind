            We purchase and resell Microsoft licenses, Microsoft operating
            systems and Microsoft Office packages unused by businesses and
            companies for reasons of migration to cloud or subscription
            services, thus restoring value to these unused assets by
            reintroducing them into the international market at affordable
            prices, with savings of up to 80% compared to base price.
          </p>
          <h3>Are our licenses legally compliant?</h3>
          <p>
            Thanks to the judgment issued by the Court of Justice on July 3,
            2012, (c-128/11) which legitimized the sale of refurbished software,
            we can now offer substantial savings to our customers and our
            services as a reliable provider. Within the framework of current
            legislation, we work hard to source and test software from companies
            all across Europe to offer genuine Microsoft licenses which are
            fully compliant with Microsoft terms and applicable EU Software
            Directives
          </p>
          <h4>Judgment of 2012:</h4>
          <h4>
            <strong>
              <i>- "ECJ, judgment of 3.7.2012, Case C-128/11"</i>

            Software producers cannot defend themselves against the resale of
            used software. The exclusive right to distribute the program copy is
            exhausted with the first sale. In this judgment, the Court states
            that the principle of exhaustion of the right to distribution
            applies not only when software copies are sold on data carriers but
            also when they are distributed by downloading from the company's
            website.

          <h4>Judgment of 2016:</h4>
          <h4>
            <strong>
              <i>
                - "Judgment of the Münster Public Procurement Chamber of
                01.03.2016, Ref. VK 1-2/16"
              </i>
            </strong>
          </h4>
          <p>
            The exclusion of already used software from the tenders violates
            public procurement law. The Public Procurement Chamber of the
            Government of Münster thus clarified that used software can no
            longer be excluded from tenders. The commitment to new software from
            Microsoft violates the principle of neutrality in the tendering
            process. Such a restriction could no longer be objectively
            justified. Used licences are not deviations from the original. On
            the contrary, they cannot be distinguished from the original
            version. VK Münster recommends that purchasers of used software
            obtain a certificate certifying that the copy has been uninstalled.
            This could be agreed upon in the contract by a so-called exemption
            agreement. A further marking of the rights chain is not necessary
            and cannot be claimed.
          </p>
          <h4>Judgment of 2013:</h4>
          <h4>
            <i>
              - "Judgment of the Federal Court of Justice of 17.7.2013, Case I
              ZR 129/08"
            </i>
          </h4>
          <p>
            With its decision of 2013, the BGH confirmed that the trade with
            used software licenses is lawful. About one year after the European
            Court of Justice, the BGH also dealt with the legal situation of the
            trade with used software licenses. It confirmed the decision of the
            ECJ in its entirety.
          </p>
          <h4>Judgment of 2014:</h4>
          <h4>
            <i>
              - "Federal Court of Justice (BGH), judgement of 11.12.2014, file
              number I ZR 8/13"
            </i>
          </h4>
          <p>
            The Federal Court of Justice (BGH) ruled that the ECJ's ruling is
            also relevant for volume license agreements and their splitting.
            With this ruling, the BGH rejected Adobe's appeal in its entirety.
            Therefore, it now applies that software licenses from volume license
            agreements may be sold individually. The purchase of individual used
            licenses from volume licenses is thus legally secure and is in no
            way risky for the buyers of used software.
          </p>
          <h4>Judgment of 2016:</h4>
          <h4>
            <i>- "OLG, judgment of August 2016, ref. 406 HKO 148/16"</i>
          </h4>
          <p>
            The Higher Regional Court of Hamburg has decided that no disclosure
            of the rights chain can be demanded. With this decision, the Higher
            Regional Court prevents the statement that the disclosure of the
            rights chain, i.e. the previous owner of a license, is necessary for
            the trade with used software.
