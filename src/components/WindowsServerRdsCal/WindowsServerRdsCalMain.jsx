            <h4>Explain Windows Server RDS CALs.</h4>
            <p>
              CALs (Client Access Licenses) are essential for enabling remote
              clients to access the services offered by a server instance.
              Windows Server RDS CALs specifically facilitate access to remote
              desktop services managed by the RDS component in Windows Server.
              This can be achieved through either Windows Server RDS USER CALs
              or DEVICE CALs, depending on user or device-based licensing.
            </p>

            <p>
              At TheKeymind, we offer license bundles ranging from 1 to 50
              units, allowing you to choose the quantity that suits your
              specific needs. One of the key advantages we provide is the
              flexibility to activate your license only when you require it,
              with no time limitations. Whether you need a license for Windows
              Server 2022 or any other version available in our catalog, we are
              here to cater to your licensing requirements.
